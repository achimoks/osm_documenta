### How a cultural mega event effects city life
### Documenta, Kassel
    
* the 'Documenta' is one of the biggest art exhibitions worldwide (it is open for 100 days)
* it happens every 5 years in Kassel, Germany (the city where I did my Psychology MSc and BSc)
* While Kassel hast 200.000 inhabitants, the Documenta attracts 900.000 visitors during the 100 days of exhibition - city life is transformed!
* from each of the past 14 Documentas, you can find urban traces - permanent installations that became sights, new bars, cafes, cultural centres, ...
* I'd like to find these traces / urban changes in OSM data (the last Documenta 14 was in 2017)
